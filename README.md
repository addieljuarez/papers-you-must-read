# Papers-You-Must-Read

Watching a video from a talk by Norberto Ortigoza [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-gvJgjgfeA&list=PLnLzwYW6HOC6OSE6CpMAf_VoqTdl_ovP3&index=4](CÃ³mo no creer en la magia - Norberto Ortigoza). 
I had an idea to create a collaboratived repository to put all the papers that we think we must read about computer science. Working together to improve computer science understanding.
